[Pymon 1.0.0] 2022-12-28:18:33:39,63 DEBUG    [utils.py:44] Generating keywords from following query: Short-circuit evaluation is when a compiler skips the execution or evaluation of some sub-expressions in a logical expression (ex: in a while loop or if statement). The compiler stops evaluating the further sub-expressions as soon as the value of the expression is determined. This practice is often used to save resources and memory, leading to more efficient code.

The compiler stops evaluating the further sub-expressions as soon as the value of the expression is determined. This practice is often used to save resources and memory, leading to more efficient code.

The compiler stops evaluating the further sub-expressions as soon as the value of the expression is determined. This practice is often used to save resources and memory, leading to more efficient code.
